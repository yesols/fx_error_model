## Organize data files

FoldX datasets from MD snapshots are in /data directory. These text files are read and organized into arrays for further manipulation and analysis.

```{r}
path_f <- "../data/fold_data/"
path_b <- "../data/bind_data/"
dns_f <- sort(list.files(path_f))
dns_b <- sort(list.files(path_b))
fns_f <- list.files(paste(path_f, dns_f[1], sep = ""))
fns_b <- list.files(paste(path_b, dns_b[1], sep = ""))
sys_names_f <- sapply(strsplit(dns_f, "_"), "[", 1)
sys_names_b <- sapply(strsplit(dns_b, "_"), "[", 1)

# FOLD DATA
# Read in ddg_exp.txt for sys names, muts, exp ddg values


```
