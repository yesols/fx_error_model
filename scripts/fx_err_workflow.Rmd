## Organize data files

FoldX datasets from MD snapshots are in /data directory. These text files are read and organized into arrays for further manipulation and analysis.

```{r}
path_f <- "../data/fold_data/"
path_b <- "../data/bind_data/"
dns_f <- sort(list.files(path_f))
dns_b <- sort(list.files(path_b))
fns_f <- list.files(paste(path_f, dns_f[1], sep = "")) #files in each sys dir are identical, so grab them from 1bni
fns_b <- list.files(paste(path_b, dns_b[1], sep = ""))
sys_names_f <- sapply(strsplit(dns_f, "_"), "[", 1)
sys_names_b <- sapply(strsplit(dns_b, "_"), "[", 1)

# FOLD DATA
# Read in ddg_exp.txt for sys names, muts, exp ddg values
list_sys <- list()
list_mut <- list()
list_ddg_exp <- list()
for (i in 1:length(dns_f)){
  list_sys[[i]] <- read.table(paste(path_f, dns_f[i], "/ddg_exp.txt", sep = ""))[1]
  list_mut[[i]] <- read.table(paste(path_f, dns_f[i], "/ddg_exp.txt", sep = ""))[2]
  list_ddg_exp[[i]] <- read.table(paste(path_f, dns_f[i], "/ddg_exp.txt", sep = ""))[3]
}
sys <- tolower(unlist(list_sys))
mut <- unlist(list_mut)
ddg_exp <- unlist(list_ddg_exp)
list_exp <- list("systems" = sys, "mut" = mut, "ddg_exp" = ddg_exp)
fold <- as.data.frame(list_exp)
# Get rest of the energy terms into the df
col_names_f <- fns_f
col_names_f <- sub("[.]txt", "", col_names_f)
#col_names_f <- col_names_f[!(col_names_f %in% c("ddg_exp","mut","total"))] #If want to exclude total
col_names_f <- col_names_f[!(col_names_f %in% c("ddg_exp","mut"))] #include total
list_vals <- list()
for (i in 1:length(col_names_f)){
  vals_i <- list()
  for (j in 1:length(dns_f)){
    vals_i[[j]] <- read.table(paste(path_f,dns_f[j],"/",col_names_f[i],".txt",sep=""))[1]
  }
  list_vals[[col_names_f[i]]] <- unlist(vals_i)
}
# Combine into a single df
fold <- cbind(fold, as.data.frame(list_vals))
# Add "error" columne
fold$error <- abs(fold$total-fold$ddg_exp)
